It is hard or nearly impossible to predict the kinds of applications that will be built on top of æternity. However, it is easy to envision that upgrades to the core blockchain will be needed. We want the consent and buy-in of our user community before making changes. We also want the community to propose blockchain extensions but don’t want to be the single arbiter to judge whether or not to make them happen.

We provide a governance approach where users can vote on core software changes and system parameters (e.g. block size or frequency), with votes counting proportionally to the number of AE each user is voting with.

The AE will be locked up for the period of the vote and it will not be possible to use the same AE to vote more than once. The prevailing side will decide if the features will be rolled out or not, as well as, changes to the system parameters made. This will cause a “hard fork”, with the owners of the nodes voting for the changes by upgrading their software (or not).
