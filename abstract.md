To replace existing centralized mechanisms, a blockchain needs to scale to thousands of transactions per second in a decentralized and trustless way, as well as make use of real world data. For some transactions a true instant confirmation is required and data is best kept private, off the chain.

We present Ã¦ternity, a multi-asset blockchain for decentralized and trustless applications that can seamlessly access real-world data. We offer scalability and privacy via state channels. We run Ethereum smart contracts that can use data supplied by off-chain data providers (oracles). 

To avoid Bitcoin hard-forking issues, we provide a built-in governance mechanism that enables users to vote on future upgrades to core functionality, as well as to tune system parameters. 

Last but not least, we include an identity and naming system, and a mechanism to create custom tokens.

Our software is written in Erlang/OTP, a fault-tolerant and industrial-strength platform used to develop telecom software. Erlang allows us to release new features and bug fixes at a rapid clip while maintaining a very stable network.
