Despite all the security and safety issues associated with Solidity programming, it has become the most popular smart contract language in the blockchain space. We are looking to allow Solidity smart contracts to run on top of æternity without any modifications.

æternity blockchain nodes will not become part of the Ethereum network but we will leverage the large body of smart contract code written in Solidity and the skills of the many programmers who know how to write it.

We will also try to improve on the Ethereum VM wherever possible, e.g. by only charging for space actually used by a smart contract.
